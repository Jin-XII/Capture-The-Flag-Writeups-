Rubber Duck (EASY)

CTF Platform: CTFLearn

Category: Steganography
Objective: Extract a hidden message from an image file.

Approach
  I was given a .jpg file. Since no visible information was apparent, I used an online steganography tool to inspect hidden data.

Steps
  Upload the image to StegOnline

  Use the Show Strings option to inspect embedded text data.

  Several strings appeared, one of which contained the flag.

Flag
flag{rubber_duck_debugging}
